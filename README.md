Title: Sudoku Solver

Description:
The Sudoku Solver is a Python program designed to automatically solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Features:
1. Input Puzzle: The program allows users to input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle represented as a 9x9 grid, where empty cells are represented by 0s. Users can define their own Sudoku puzzles or use predefined ones included in the program.

2. Backtracking Algorithm: The core of the program utilizes a backtracking algorithm to explore possible solutions for the Sudoku puzzle. The algorithm systematically tries different numbers in empty cells, backtracking when it reaches a dead-end, until it finds a valid solution.

3. Validity Check: Before placing a number in a cell, the program checks whether it's valid according to Sudoku rules. It ensures that the number doesn't already exist in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

4. User Interface: The program provides a user-friendly interface where users can see the original unsolved puzzle and the solution once it's found. It formats the Sudoku grid neatly for easy readability.

5. Error Handling: The program handles invalid input gracefully, notifying users if the input Sudoku puzzle is not solvable or if there's any other issue during the solving process.

6. Performance Optimization: Although backtracking is used, the program is designed to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles by pruning the search space whenever possible. This helps in reducing the time complexity of the solving process.

Overall, the Sudoku Solver provides a convenient tool for Sudoku enthusiasts to quickly solve puzzles without the need for manual trial and error. It showcases the power of backtracking algorithms in solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently.
